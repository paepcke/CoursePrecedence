The US higher education system is unique in the world in the extent to
which it obliges undergraduates to explore a variety of courses before
committing to a field of study. In contrast with virtually all other
national postsecondary systems, in which students enter schools and
programs with relatively structured curriculums, US undergraduates are
encouraged to explore a variety of academic options through an
iterative course search and selection process.


This exploration is fateful. It can stall timely progress toward
graduation \cite{bailey2015redesigning}, create path dependencies that
neither students nor faculty fully understand
\cite{chambliss2014college}, and reinforce inequality when academic
pathways parallel other dimensions of demographic difference among
students \cite{armstrong2013paying}. Ethnographic research suggests
that students tend to select courses based on partial, poorly
integrated information, in light of logistical constraints, and
personal preferences that have little directly to do with academics
\cite{nathan2006my,rosenbaum2011complexities, rosenbaum2007after}.

Yet, understanding the totality of curriculum options is challenging
not only for students. Other stake holders in the enterprise of higher
education also need convenient insight into the
curriculum. Instructors, department chairs, deans, provosts, and
even Boards of Trustees cannot easily gain curriculum related
insights. One challenge in mitigating this lack is that each of these
potential beneficiaries of improvement require investigative equipment
of different focal lengths. 

Day to day, {\bf academic advisors} on the ground lack tools for
understanding the characteristics of the numerous majors and programs
they are tasked to explain. For example, it is not trivial to identify
majors whose requirements have students take courses primarily within
one department. Requirement structures for majors such as Computer
Science tend to impose this more intradepartmental regime. Other
majors, such as History, instead have students consume courses such as
economics and political science. Insight into such differences are
needed for allowing advisers to help students craft a path that
matches their interests and temperament.

{\bf Instructors}, in contrast, require information local to their
specific course offerings. Yet they cannot easily answer the question
{\it Which majors, and preceding courses feed students into my class?}

{\bf Department chairs} and {\bf deans} are for different reasons in
need of knowing the migration paths of students in and out of
departments. Questions such as {\it Does our school offer a rich set
  of non-major service courses for the university?} and {\it are
  students from across campus uniformly taking advantage of such
  courses?} and difficult to answer.

Beyond such specific needs, the myriad of possible pathways through
curricula also impedes efforts by university administrators to
encourage behaviors that lead to outcomes deemed desirable by
their institutions. Such goals might emphasize persistence,
intellectual breadth, or readiness for the workplace.

The information for these needs is present in all teaching
institutions. But it is embodied in the tables of databases to which
few have access, and which would be too difficult to navigate even if
access was available for all the stake holders. Many universities have
specialized units that generate specifically requested reports for
individuals in high level academic positions\footnote{We acknowledge
  here our own version of such an {\it Institutional Research and
    Decision Support} unit, which has provided us with numerous
  insights into both needs, and relevant data at our institution.} But
they cannot interact with all the individuals in need of insight at
varying levels of detail.

Some universities have created software that surfaces a selection of
the needed information broadly to its institution's clients
(e.g. \cite{carta}). But these tools focus primarily on the very
focused need of individual students, and therefore lack the ability to
provide both overview and detailed insight.

Our approach to providing a zoomable, investigative instrument for
large scale, qualitative curriculum exploration relies on graph
theory. The approach has been applied to a number of domains and
tasks, such as detecting communities \cite{PhysRevE.70.056104},
collecting materials for survey articles \cite{ji2015}, the
augmentation of collaborative recommendation records \cite{huang2005},
predicting future collaborations between scholars \cite{liben2007},
and suggesting drug interactions \cite{zitnik2018}.

We rely primarily on student enrollment records. Our methods are
therefore applicable to any institution that maintains at least this
level of record keeping. We explain how the availability of other
data, such as demographic information greatly adds to the results that
can be achieved.

To first approximation, we convert enrollment records to directed
graphs, with nodes modeling courses, links modeling sequential
enrollment, and link weights modeling enrollment volume. We partition
the graphs by the course department origins. An existing graphing tool
\cite{shannon2003cytoscape} exposes more, or less information,
depending on zoom level.

While the concept is easy to explain, details arise that are not
immediately obvious. In addition, the most informative mapping from
enrollments to graph depends on the questions the graph is intended to
answer. Mappings can vary widely.

After related work, in Section~\ref{sec:mapping} we explain mapping
options and their implications for questions that can be
investigated. We explain our dataset in Section~\ref{sec:dataset},
followed by the details of processing the enrollment data in
preparation to their ingestion into the visualization tool. In
Section\ref{sec:visualization} we illustrate the use of Via in
contexts relevant to several stake holders.
