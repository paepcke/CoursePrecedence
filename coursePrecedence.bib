  abstract = {Community structures are an important feature of many social,
              biological, and technological networks. Here we study a variation on
              the method for detecting such communities proposed by Girvan and
              Newman and based on the idea of using centrality measures to define
              the community boundaries [M. Girvan and M. E. J. Newman,
              Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 7821 (2002)]. We develop an
              algorithm of hierarchical clustering that consists in finding and
              removing iteratively the edge with the highest information
              centrality. We test the algorithm on computer generated and real-world
              networks whose community structure is already known or has been
              studied by means of other methods. We show that our algorithm,
              although it runs to completion in a time O(n4), is very effective
              especially when the communities are very mixed and hardly detectable
              by the other methods.}

               for clinical practice, but the article screening process is time and
               labor intensive. As SRs aim to identify relevant articles with a
               specific scope, we propose that a pre-defined article relationship,
               using similarity metrics, could accelerate this process. In this
               study, we established the article relationship using MEDLINE element
               similarities and visualized the article network with the Force Atlas
               layout. We also analyzed the article networks with graph diameter,
               closeness centrality, and module classes. The results revealed the
               distribution of articles and found that included articles tended to
               aggregate together in some module classes, providing further
               evidence of the existence of strong relationships among included
               articles. This approach can be utilized to facilitate the articles
               selection process through early identification of these dominant
               module classes. We are optimistic that the use of article network
               visualization can help better SR work prioritization.  }

 abstract = {Recommender systems can provide valuable services in a
             digital library environment, as demonstrated by its commercial success
             in book, movie, and music industries. One of the most commonly-used
             and successful recommendation algorithms is collaborative filtering,
             which explores the correlations within user-item interactions to infer
             user interests and preferences. However, the recommendation quality of
             collaborative filtering approaches is greatly limited by the data
             sparsity problem. To alleviate this problem we have previously
             proposed graph-based algorithms to explore transitive user-item
             associations. In this paper, we extend the idea of analyzing user-item
             interactions as graphs and employ link prediction approaches proposed
             in the recent network modeling literature for making collaborative
             filtering recommendations. We have adapted a wide range of linkage
             measures for making recommendations. Our preliminary experimental
             results based on a book recommendation dataset show that some of these
             measures achieved significantly better performance than standard
             collaborative filtering algorithms.  }

  abstract = {Given a snapshot of a social network, can we infer
              which new interactions among its members are likely to
              occur in the near future? We formalize this question as
              the link- prediction problem , and we develop approaches
              to link prediction based on measures for analyzing the
              “prox- imity” of nodes in a network. Experiments on
              large coau- thorship networks suggest that information
              about future interactions can be extracted from network
              topology alone, and that fairly subtle measures for
              detecting node proximity can outperform more direct
              measures.  }
