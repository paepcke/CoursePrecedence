Here we study a variation on the method for detecting such communities proposed by Girvan and Newman and based on the idea of using centrality measures to define the community boundaries [M. Girvan and M. E. J. Newman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 7821 (2002)]. We develop an     algorithm of hierarchical clustering that consists in finding and
              removing iteratively the edge with the highest information
              centrality. We test the algorithm on computer generated and real-world
              networks whose community structure is already known or has been
              studied by means of other methods. We show that our algorithm,
              although it runs to completion in a time O(n4), is very effective
              especially when the communities are very mixed and hardly detectable

               specific scope, we propose that a pre-defined article relationship,
               using similarity metrics, could accelerate this process. In this
               study, we established the article relationship using MEDLINE element
               similarities and visualized the article network with the Force Atlas
               layout. We also analyzed the article networks with graph diameter,
               closeness centrality, and module classes. The results revealed the
               distribution of articles and found that included articles tended to
               aggregate together in some module classes, providing further
               evidence of the existence of strong relationships among included
               articles. This approach can be utilized to facilitate the articles
               selection process through early identification of these dominant
               module classes. We are optimistic that the use of article network
               visualization can help better SR work prioritization.  }

             in book, movie, and music industries. One of the most commonly-used
             and successful recommendation algorithms is collaborative filtering,
             which explores the correlations within user-item interactions to infer
             user interests and preferences. However, the recommendation quality of
             collaborative filtering approaches is greatly limited by the data
             sparsity problem. To alleviate this problem we have previously
             proposed graph-based algorithms to explore transitive user-item
             associations. In this paper, we extend the idea of analyzing user-item
             interactions as graphs and employ link prediction approaches proposed
             in the recent network modeling literature for making collaborative
             filtering recommendations. We have adapted a wide range of linkage
             measures for making recommendations. Our preliminary experimental
             results based on a book recommendation dataset show that some of these
             measures achieved significantly better performance than standard
             collaborative filtering algorithms.  }

abstract = {This paper explores a longitudinal approach to combining engagement, performance and social connectivity data from a MOOC using the framework of exponential random graph models (ERGMs). The idea is to model the social network in the discussion forum in a given week not only using performance (assignment scores) and overall engagement (lecture and discussion views) covariates within that week, but also on the same person-level covariates from adjacent previous and subsequent weeks. We find that over all eight weekly sessions, the social networks constructed from the forum interactions are relatively sparse and lack the tendency for preferential attachment. By analyzing data from the second week, we also find that individuals with higher performance scores from current, previous, and future weeks tend to be more connected in the social network. Engagement with lectures had significant but sometimes puzzling effects on social connectivity. However, the relationships between social connectivity, performance, and engagement weakened over time, and results were not stable across weeks. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

Among all the existing studies related to MOOCs, most of them focus on individuals' study behaviors and evaluations (e.g., analysis on click streams for video-watching behavior exploration, etc.) for course design purposes. However, in addition to traditional course materials, MOOCs also provide interactive user forums to encourage students to seek help from peers, which endows the courses with social network formation and interaction. Thus, we present NetworkSeer to help evaluate why MOOC students use forums, and what they do. NetworkSeer visualizes interactions in the forum, including where, when the interactions happen, and why. It also enables filtering out un-targeted groups. A case study is conducted to demonstrate its usefulness.},

A principal goal for ecology is to understand the nature of species interactions and to determine the extent to which they can explain the observed patterns and dynamic properties of biological communities. The most obvious interaction of all is predation. Formal presentation of the feeding links between species has often been in the form of a food web graph and these images have led some to draw an analogy between food webs and road maps. The chapter presents a brief review of patterns catalogued to date. Published food webs combine two sets of information about the community of animals and plants they represent: a list of the elements in the system, and the distribution of feeding link (information on who eats whom). The chapter also discusses food web models and concentrates on the underlying principles of these modeling approaches; Lotka-Volterra: an industry standard, model predictions and the effects of data re-evaluation, community assembly, and the cascade model. {\textcopyright} 1993 Academic Press Limited},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known--a collaboration network and a food web--and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

abstract = {A critical part of ecological studies is to quantify how landscape spatial heterogeneity affects species' distributions. With advancements in remote sensing technology and GIS, we now live in a data-rich era allowing us to investigate species-environment relationships in heterogeneous landscapes at multiple spatial scales. However, the degree and type of spatial heterogeneity changes depending on the spatial scale at which species-environment relationships are analysed. Here we present the current spatial analytic methods used in ecological studies to quantify ecological spatial heterogeneity. To determine the key spatial scales at which underlying ecological processes act upon species, we recommend use of spectral decomposition techniques such as wavelet analysis or Moran's eigenvector maps. Following this, a suite of spatial regression methods can be used to quantify the relative influence of environmental factors on species' distributions. Finally, spatial graph metrics can be employed to quantify the effects of spatial heterogeneity on landscape connectivity across or within species' ranges and can be used as additional predictors in spatial regression models. We emphasize how spatial statistics, spatial regression, and spatial graph theory can be used to provide insights into how landscape spatial complexity influences species distributions and to better understand species response to global change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The current enrollment surge has exceeded previous CS booms, and there is a general sense that the current growth in enrollment is substantially different than that of the mid-1980s and late 1990s. To investigate the current situation, the Computing Research Association (CRA) produced an enrollment survey to measure, assess, and better understand enrollment trends and their impact on computer science units, diversity, and more. Part of this effort included a survey of doctoral- and non-doctoral granting academic units in fall 2015.

abstract = {A Social Learning Network (SLN) emerges when users exchange information on educational topics with structured interactions. The recent proliferation of massively scaled online (human) learning, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), has presented a plethora of research challenges surrounding SLN. In this paper, we ask: How efficient are these networks? We propose a framework in which SLN efficiency is determined by comparing user benefit in the observed network to a benchmark of maximum utility achievable through optimization. Our framework defines the optimal SLN through utility maximization subject to a set of constraints that can be inferred from the network. Through evaluation on four MOOC discussion forum datasets and optimizing over millions of variables, we find that SLN efficiency can be rather low (from 68{\%} to 82{\%} depending on the specific parameters and dataset), which indicates that much can be gained through optimization. We find that the gains in global utility (i.e., average across users) can be obtained without making the distribution of local utilities (i.e., utility of individual users) less fair. We also discuss ways of realizing the optimal network in practice, through curated news feeds in online SLN.},

@misc{Babad2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior to every term, students must select courses (i.e., academic units of instruction within a degree programme) to determine their study programme. Course selection (CS) is a sequential decision-making (DM) process--students weigh various types of information available about each course. Every decision influences the weighting of considerations for the next. This study is focused on three central dimensions of CS: Learning Value (low or high in being intellectually challenging, interesting and thought-provoking), Lecturer's Style (low or high--exciting, charismatic and humorous versus dry, inflexible, unclear, etc.), and Course Difficulty (easy, moderate or hard). AIMS: (1) To examine students' preferences for each dimension in five choices and in their sequential location (1st to 5th). (2) To trace compromises in dilemma situations after the desirable combinations had already been selected. (3) To investigate differential selection as a function of students' age, gender, and academic standing (average grades). SAMPLE: Advanced undergraduates in various departments in an Israeli university (N = 1,007). METHOD: In an experimental design, respondents were presented with 12 course descriptions representing 2x2x3 combinations, and asked to select five courses in a sequential order. RESULTS: The 12 courses were found to be empirically divided into: ideal courses (2), first-degree (4) and second-degree (4) compromises, and rejected courses (2). Students avoided selecting hard courses unless they had no choice. Learning Value was the most preferred dimension, followed closely by Lecturer Style. Correlations showed that older and higher achieving students chose more difficult and high Learning Value courses. COMMENTS: The discussion centred on the methodological issue of the effectiveness of an experimental design for the investigation of CS, conceptual issues concerning Course Difficulty in students' selection and evaluation, and applied issues concerning the availability of information about the three investigated dimensions to students in real-life CS.},

               perform two student preference experiments on students
               at two large four-year universities to determine how
               students might respond to increasing guidance or
               reduced choice in their course-taking options. We find
               that students do not respond strongly to increases in
               guidance, but strongly reject a reduction in options,
               even when given a rationale for the reduction. These
               results suggest that increased-guidance policies have
               some avenues to operate in without student pushback,
               but that strong reductions in choice are unlikely to be
               popular.  From her paper - “One explanation that has
               been suggested for low graduation rates is that a lack
               of structure and the predominance of complex
               requirements in curricular programs leaves students
               burdened by many, repeated choices they don’t
               understand well and may make poorly. This is especially
               for students who have little experience with the system
               (Jenkins & Cho, 2013; Scott-Clayton,
               2015). Scott-Clayton (2015) formulates this explanation
               in the context of community colleges, but at four-year
               colleges, too, graduation requirements and
               prerequisites are often deeply complex and require the
               student to make many choices.}
